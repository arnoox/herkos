- benchmark embedded (code size + runtime performance)
- benchmark transpiler (runtime performance)
- for testing: wat generator, for transpiler testing purpose, deterministic, input: function size, # of function, # of imports, # of globals, memory size, ...
- transpiler can generate mocks for making 1st time integration easier.
- code coverage tooling + runtime.
- test on hardware.
- import embedded hal.
- host side helpers for manipulating memory, taking endianess into account.
- determinism
- provide simpl example project
- think of a more complex project with embedded. E.g. embedded, i2c, accelration sensor, send data over mqtt.
- verifier in a seprated repo
- make all crate names consistent
- make the transpiler's lib side work like the cc crate in a build.rs
- --max-pages has no effect!
- Getting started section is too big.
